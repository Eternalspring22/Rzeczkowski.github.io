							<h2>Abstract</h2>
							<h3>Context</h3>
							<p>Forensic accounting can be considered a special case of data analysis, as it involves analyzing and interpreting financial data to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies that may indicate fraudulent activity.</p>
							<p>In this project, I’ll build a simple financial model to understand impact of a respondent’s actions taken in context of a legal filings surrounding a divorce proceeding. The financial model will help me to verify and correctly place data on timeline of events.</p>
							<h3>Central Issue</h3>
							<p>Using data analysis and Excel I will demonstrate fraud and calculate the impact of that fraud.</p>

							<h2>Support</h2>
							<p>I recently went through divorce and that experience presented me not only with the opportunity to retrain and seek a new career as data analyst, but also to practice my new chosen field on my own data. It’s a win-win as they say.</p>
							<p>The data in this case are claims made by my ex-wife and claims made by professionals she hired to represent her in court.</p>
							<p>The claims relate to financial data, cash flows and budgets. Unfortunately, the numbers calculated at great expense to my ex-wife by a Baker Tilly partner, appear to conflict with the information from the sale of our house.</p>
							<p>Let’s look at the data we have:</p>
							<!-- this leaves a line along with an indent
							<blockquote>
							</blockquote>
							-->
							<h3>Apr 2020</h3>
							<p style="margin-left: 50px;">Respondent has applied for <a href="https://www.wellsfargo.com/mortgage/manage-account/payment-help/forbearance-plan/">Forbearance Plan</a> and stoped making Mortgage PMTs for the next 17 months. (I only discover this at the time of the sale of our house 17 months after the fact.)</p>
							<p style="margin-left: 50px;">Per <a href="https://www.wellsfargo.com/mortgage/manage-account/payment-help/forbearance-plan/">Wells Fargo Forbearance Plan website:</a> “You must contact us on a monthly basis to provide regular updates on your financial status.”</p>
							<h3>Aug 12 2020</h3>
							<p style="margin-left: 50px;">Judge issues temporary ruling where he cites that mother denies hitting Father with a lamp. Mother alleges that Father has been the one to escalate conflicts physically.</p>
							<p style="margin-left: 50px;">In the Findings of Fact, among other expenses attributable to the respondent, the judge declares that the principal and interest payment on the Homestead is $4,309 per month.</p>
							<h3>Sep 16 2020</h3>
							<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><a href="https://www.bakertilly.com">Baker Tilly Partner</a> submits an affidavit along with the respondent’s affidavit:</p>
								<ul style="margin-left: 50px;">
									<li>Respondent talks at length about the burden of paying House Mortgage.</li>
									<li>Respondent submits monthly budget of $18,899. First line item is the House Mortgage PMT of $4,309.40</li>
									<li>Baker Tilly Partner is asked to calculate 2020 cash flow projection for the respondent.</li>
									<li>Baker Tilly Partner is asked to assume respondents 2019 income of $160K for 2020 income. It is September of 2020, but he does not push back and does what he is asked.</li>
									<li>Based on the understated income Baker Tilly Partner calculates $11K monthly short fall for the respondent.</li>
									<li>In the cash flow calculation Bake Tilly Partner uses $35K of Home Mortgage Interest as allowable deduction.</li>
								</ul>
							<h3>Jan 5 2021</h3>
							<p style="margin-left: 50px;">The judge DENIES my motion for need-based attorney fee. Baker Tilly Partner cash flow shortfall is cited verbatim. The judge repeats what he is told in the affidavits: “She pays mortgage.”</p>
							<h3>Jan 7 2022</h3>
							<p style="margin-left: 50px;">Baker Tilly Partner testifies at my Divorce Trial representing my ex-wife.</p>
							<p style="margin-left: 50px;">Baker Tilly Partner was asked to prepare:</p>
								<ul style="margin-left: 100px;">
									<li>Cash Flows for myself and for my ex-wife. </li>
									<li>Projections of child support my ex-wife would have to pay me.</li>
								</ul>
							<p style="margin-left: 50px;">It is January of 2022. My ex-wife has asked the Baker Tilly partner to use her 2020 income of $190K as a placeholder for her 2021 income. We know that her 2021 Income was $385K.</p>
							<p style="margin-left: 50px;">Unable to hire a forensic accountant, I was dealing with the fraud in progress myself as I was looking for work. As a trailing spouse I had no meaningful income. However, a Certified Rehabilitation Counselor for a few thousand dollars was willing to make up a number for my income for the respondent. The man has not seen me, not spoken with me, just looked at my CV and claimed I can easily make $100K to $125K a year. I hope my future employer takes a note of this.</p>
							<p style="margin-left: 50px;">Baker Tilly Partner, using 2020 income in 2022 as a placeholder for 2021 income for my ex-wife, and a made-up number for my income calculated that I should receive $241 in monthly child support.</p>
							<h3>June 21 2022</h3>
							<p style="margin-left: 50px;">Judge rules that I should receive $241 in monthly child support and nothing else. Judge cites verbatim the supporting numbers used by the Baker Tilly Partner.</p>
							<p style="margin-left: 50px;">As this GitHub project demonstrates, having completed the Google Data Analyst Certificate, I am working on building up a portfolio of projects to woo an employer. I am NO Certified Rehabilitation Counselor. If I was supposed to be paid $100K to $125K for this analysis, please let me know.</p>
							<p>Incomplete as it is, we have all the data for this project. The question is how do all the data points make sense? Is there anything fraudulent about this? If there is, can we demonstrate the fraud and calculate its impact?</p>

							<h2>Process</h2>
							<p>To make sense of the data I will need to understand all the moving parts and implications of:</p>
								<ul style="margin-left: 50px;">
									<li>Skipping seventeen (17) mortgage payments. </li>
									<li>If or how that impacts the Baker Tilly Partner provided calculations.</li>
								</ul>

							<p>Before I jump into the cleaning and organizing of data, I must ask:</p>
							<h3>Why Baker Tilly?</h3>
							<p>The cost of expert testimony varies widely depending on the complexity of the matter and the expertise of the expert witness. I estimate that two affidavits and court expert testimony by a partner costed around $10K.</p>
							<p>Partner testimony from a <a href="https://www.bakertilly.com/page/about-us">globally recognized, top ten advisory, tax and assurance firm</a> seams over the top.  What is going on? What is it that you purchase from a Baker Tilly Partner. The calculations are not overly complicated. Thus, it appears to me that the high price is mostly for borrowing the firm’s reputation.</p>
							<p>Let’s look at the anatomy of the Baker Tilly Partner Affidavit:</p>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/F_BakerTilly.jpeg" alt="Anatomy of a Baker Tilly affidavit" /></span>
							<p>Page two is mostly blank short of the partner signature. Thus, it is five out of seven pages devoted to glorifying the credibility of the author.</p>
							<p>Unfortunately, it appears to have worked. In each instance, the Judge has rubberstamped the Baker Tilly Provided numbers and regurgitated them in so called Findings of Facts or his Rulings.</p>
							<h3>Enough about Baker Tilly. Back to data cleaning and organizing.</h3>

							<p>To make sure I have all the moving parts of the loan I created a Mortgage Amortization Schedule in Excel. <a href="OurHouseMortgage.xlsx">Click Here to download the Excel file.</a></p>
							<p>Mortgage amortization refers to the process of paying off a mortgage loan over time through regular payments. The term "amortization" comes from the Latin word "amortis," which means "to kill," and it refers to the gradual reduction of a debt through periodic payments.</p>
							<p>The benefit of amortizing loan is that the monthly payment is constant throughout the life of the loan. However, the two components of the loan, principal and interest, vary over time. In early years, the amount of the payment that goes towards the interest makes up larger portion of the mortgage payment. In the later years the principal makes up larger portion of the mortgage payment. I will need this detail to identify the underlying assumptions behind the Baker Tilly Partner stated $35K of Home Mortgage Interest as allowable deduction for 2020. </p>
							<p>Let’s see how this looks like in context of the entire loan.</p>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/F_InterestDeduction.jpeg" alt="Mortgage payment components" /></span>
							<p>Immediately, we can see that the $35K of Home Mortgage Interest for 2020 cited by Baker Tilly Partner checks out with our excel model. The number is correct, and it assumes that all mortgage payments are made as scheduled.</p>
							<p>If you look at the Excel file, on the Mortgage tab you will see the loan inputs. The last input is a toggle switch where you can set the COVID 19 Forbearance Plan to True or False. If the setting is set to True, the payments are stopped for 17 months, if the setting is set to False, the payments are made as scheduled.</p>
							<p>The thing to watch is how the ending balance of the mortgage is impacted by turning the Forbearance on and off.</p>
							<p>The ending balance at any given period in the file gives me the projected mortgage payoff amount.</p>
							<p>The mortgage amortization table is the key to understanding what has happened, vs, the story the court was told of what has happened.</p>
							<p>With mortgage amortization table in hand, we can shift to next phase of the project.</p>

							<h2>Analysis</h2>
							<p>Here is the data that presents a problem.</p>
							<p>Our house sale closed in September 2021. According to the draft settlement statement, the mortgage payoff amount was $879K.</p>
							<p>First red flag is that our initial mortgage amount was $876K, $3K less than the mortgage payoff amount.</p>
							<p>Referencing the Excel amortization schedule, the ending balance of the loan in September 2021 would have been $800K if all the scheduled payments were made.</p>
							<p>My ex-wife lawyer, when pressured to explain the surprisingly high mortgage payoff amount at the time of sale of the house, stated that my ex-wife has qualified for a COVID-19 relief program. She took advantage of the program for 17 months.</p>
							<h3>Reconciliation</h3>
							<p>If I assume that no payments were made for the 17-month forbearance period, my mortgage amortization schedule indicates that loan payoff amount would jump to $898K. That is $18.5K higher than the loan payoff amount provided my ex-wife lawyer. For extra credit you can look this up in the Excel file.</p>
							<p>As stated, forbearance is intended as a short-term relief. It is plausible that during the 17-month ordeal Wells Fargo requested some nominal amount to be paid. The lawyer provided loan payoff amount indicates that $18.5K was paid in over the 17-month forbearance period.</p>
							<p>In aggregate the forbearance period increased the loan payoff amount by $79K versus what it would have been had the scheduled payments been made. If the dribble of $18.5K of forbearance payment were not made, the extraction of value from the mortgage would have been $98K. I will not quibble about misrepresenting financials to the toon of $79K vs $98K. Either way financial data was significantly and materially misrepresented.</p>

							<h3>Temporary Hardship</h3>
							<p>Pursuant to the CARES Act Wells Fargo is required to offer a <a href="https://www.wellsfargo.com/mortgage/manage-account/payment-help/forbearance-plan/">Forbearance Plan</a> to assist people going through temporary hardship. Wells Fargo also refers to the plan as COVID-19 short-term payment assistance. To receive the forbearance, all she had to do is lie. You qualify for the plan by telling your loan servicer that you are going through a financial hardship because of the pandemic. The mortgage servicer is not permitted to ask you for proof of hardship.</p>
							<p>Though the Wells Fargo website states that “You must contact us on a monthly basis to provide regular updates on your financial status.” This is relevant as you think about the number of overlapping interactions with Wells Fargo on mortgage relief and interactions with Baker Tilly Partner on divorce portrayal of the mortgage. CARES Act mandates that this relief is offered for up to 18 months.</p>
							<p>My ex-wife lawyer has stated that she has qualified for a COVID-19 relief program. That is almost true. She qualified by lying to the bank. I do not believe that’s illegal. That’s between her and the bank. However, having received a relief from the bank by laying to the bank and lying to the court about the ongoing hardship of making the mortgage payments without disclosing the relief, well, that’s perjury.</p>
							<p>bla bla bla underline me</p>
							<p>Eight (8) of the seventeen (17) forbearance months fall into 2020 calendar year when my ex-wife tax income was $190K. Nine (9) of the (17) forbearance months fall into 2021 calendar year when my ex-wife tax income was $385K. Also our balance sheet was very strong before I filed for divorce.</p>
							<p>bla bla <p style="text-decoration: underline;">This is some underlined text.</p>bla undeeline me</p>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/F_Distress.jpeg" alt="Wells Fargo definition of financial distress" /></span>
							<p>The fact remains, my ex-wife used Forbearance Plan to extract $79K out of the house mortgage while making what most would call a nice income and with access to considerable financial reserves.</p>
							<p>In practice this unequivocally means that for the 17 months forbearance period, mortgage payments were either suspended or significantly reduced.</p>
							<p>The problem is that precisely during the time when the forbearance was in force, five months into the forbearance period to be precise, my ex-wife filed a sworn affidavit with the court where she discussed at length how burdensome and costly the mortgage payment is. The very mortgage she was NOT paying. In fact, her affidavit included a budget where the very first item was the mortgage payment.</p>
							<p>If a federal prosecutor wants a proof that her $19K court submitted budget is fraud and perjury as well, I have all the credit card recites and all the documents to prove we lived on around $13K a month. I am happy to help the law in any way possible.</p>
							<p>This is both Fraud and Perjury. Fraud involves making false statements or representations to deceive or mislead someone for personal or financial gain. In situations where a person makes a fraudulent statement while under oath or while affirming the truth of a statement it is Perjury.</p>
							<p>Ironically, the defendant spent thousands of dollars on Baker Tilly Partner to lend his credibility in reporting the fraudulent numbers to the court. Is that a Perjury squared?</p>
							<p>Retaining Baker Tilly is a fascinating wrinkle in the story. As millennials say, the Baker Tilly Partner understood his assignment. The partner has decades of experience and lists in his litany of credentials that he is certified in financial forensics. Yet for some reason, it did not occur to him at any point over his several years long engagement on my ex-wife case to ask for a current copy of the mortgage statement. Had he chosen to do some due diligence, he would have seen that his client is in fact in forbearance plan. That is a material fact that was omitted.</p>
							<p>Now that we have established the activity as fraud and perjury, let’s try to present it as clear as possible.</p>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/F_PayoffAmount.jpeg" alt="Mortgage Payoff Amount and Total Amount Defrauded" /></span>
							<p>My case is in appeals court. Our marital assets are yet to be divided. I have no idea how much of the $79K is mine. That does not change the character of the deceitful actions undertaken by my ex-wife.</p>
							<p>Perhaps a waterfall chart is even more transparent illustration of what transpired.</p>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/F_Forebearance.jpeg" alt="Impact of forbearance on mortgage payoff amount" /></span>
							<p>Ultimately the Perjuries and Fraud had serious consequences. Here is a timeline of events that shows how things unfolded.</p>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/F_LockHerUp.jpeg" alt="Timeline of fraudulent events, Perjury is a crime" /></span>
							<p>Now that the facts and conclusions are out of the way, let’s shift to positive constructive thoughts on what can be learned from this.</p>
