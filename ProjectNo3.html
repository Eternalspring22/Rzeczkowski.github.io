							<h2>Abstract</h2>
							<h3>Context</h3>
							<p>Forensic accounting can be considered a special case of data analysis, as it involves analyzing and interpreting financial data to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies that may indicate fraudulent activity.</p>
							<p>In this project, I’ll build a simple financial model to understand impact of a respondent’s actions taken in context of a legal filings surrounding a divorce proceeding. The financial model will help me to verify and correctly place data on timeline of events.</p>
							<h3>Central Issue</h3>
							<p>Using data analysis and Excel I will demonstrate fraud and calculate the impact of that fraud.</p>

							<h2>Support</h2>
							<p>I recently went through divorce and that experience presented me not only with the opportunity to retrain and seek a new career as data analyst, but also to practice my new chosen field on my own data. It’s a win-win as they say.</p>
							<p>The data in this case are claims made by my ex-wife and claims made by professionals she hired to represent her in court.</p>
							<p>The claims relate to financial data, cash flows and budgets. Unfortunately, the numbers calculated at great expense to my ex-wife by a Baker Tilly partner, appear to conflict with the information from the sale of our house.</p>
							<p>Let’s look at the data we have:</p>

							<blockquote>
							</blockquote>
							-->
							<h3>Apr 2020</h3>
							<p style="margin-left: 50px;">Respondent has applied for <a href="https://www.wellsfargo.com/mortgage/manage-account/payment-help/forbearance-plan/">Forbearance Plan</a> and stoped making Mortgage PMTs for the next 17 months. (I only discover this at the time of the sale of our house 17 months after the fact.)</p>
							<p style="margin-left: 50px;">Per <a href="https://www.wellsfargo.com/mortgage/manage-account/payment-help/forbearance-plan/">Wells Fargo Forbearance Plan website:</a> “You must contact us on a monthly basis to provide regular updates on your financial status.”</p>
							<h3>Aug 12 2020</h3>
							<p style="margin-left: 50px;">Judge issues temporary ruling where he cites that mother denies hitting Father with a lamp. Mother alleges that Father has been the one to escalate conflicts physically.</p>
							<p style="margin-left: 50px;">In the Findings of Fact, among other expenses attributable to the respondent, the judge declares that the principal and interest payment on the Homestead is $4,309 per month.</p>
							<h3>Sep 16 2020</h3>
							<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><a href="https://www.bakertilly.com">Baker Tilly Partner</a> submits an affidavit along with the respondent’s affidavit:</p>
								<ul style="margin-left: 50px;">
									<li>Respondent talks at length about the burden of paying House Mortgage.</li>
									<li>Respondent submits monthly budget of $18,899. First line item is the House Mortgage PMT of $4,309.40</li>
									<li>Baker Tilly Partner is asked to calculate 2020 cash flow projection for the respondent.</li>
									<li>Baker Tilly Partner is asked to assume respondents 2019 income of $160K for 2020 income. It is September of 2020, but he does not push back and does what he is asked.</li>
									<li>Based on the understated income Baker Tilly Partner calculates $11K monthly short fall for the respondent.</li>
									<li>In the cash flow calculation Bake Tilly Partner uses $35K of Home Mortgage Interest as allowable deduction.</li>
								</ul>
							<h3>Jan 5 2021</h3>
							<p style="margin-left: 50px;">The judge DENIES my motion for need-based attorney fee. Baker Tilly Partner cash flow shortfall is cited verbatim. The judge repeats what he is told in the affidavits: “She pays mortgage.”</p>
							<h3>Jan 7 2022</h3>
							<p style="margin-left: 50px;">Baker Tilly Partner testifies at my Divorce Trial representing my ex-wife.</p>
							<p style="margin-left: 50px;">Baker Tilly Partner was asked to prepare:</p>
								<ul style="margin-left: 50px;">
									<li>Cash Flows for myself and for my ex-wife. </li>
									<li>Projections of child support my ex-wife would have to pay me.</li>
								</ul>
							<p style="margin-left: 50px;">It is January of 2022. My ex-wife has asked the Baker Tilly partner to use her 2020 income of $190K as a placeholder for her 2021 income. We know that her 2021 Income was $385K.</p>
							<p style="margin-left: 50px;">Unable to hire a forensic accountant, I was dealing with the fraud in progress myself as I was looking for work. As a trailing spouse I had no meaningful income. However, a Certified Rehabilitation Counselor for a few thousand dollars was willing to make up a number for my income for the respondent. The man has not seen me, not spoken with me, just looked at my CV and claimed I can easily make $100K a year. I hope my future employer takes a note of this.</p>
							<p style="margin-left: 50px;">Baker Tilly Partner, using 2020 income in 2022 as a placeholder for 2021 income for my ex-wife, and a made-up number for my income calculated that I should receive $241 in monthly child support.</p>
							<h3>June 21 2022</h3>
							<p style="margin-left: 50px;">Judge rules that I should receive $241 in monthly child support and nothing else. Judge cites verbatim the supporting numbers used by the Baker Tilly Partner.</p>
							<p style="margin-left: 50px;">As this GitHub project demonstrates, having completed the Google Data Analyst Certificate, I am working on building up a portfolio of projects to woo an employer. I am NO Certified Rehabilitation Counselor. If I was supposed to be paid $100K for this, please let me know.</p>
							<p>Incomplete as it is, we have all the data for this project. The question is how do all the data points make sense? Is there anything fraudulent about this? Can we demonstrate the fraud and calculate its impact?</p>

							<h2>Process</h2>
							<p>To make sense of the data I will need to understand all the moving parts and implications of:</p>
								<ul style="margin-left: 50px;">
									<li>Skipping seventeen (17) mortgage payments. </li>
									<li>If or how that impacts the Baker Tilly Partner provided calculations.</li>
								</ul>

							<p>Before I jump into the cleaning and organizing of data, I must ask:</p>
							<h3>Why Baker Tilly?</h3>
							<p>The cost of expert testimony varies widely depending on the complexity of the matter and the expertise of the expert witness. I estimate that two affidavits and court expert testimony by a partner costed around $10K.</p>
							<p>Partner testimony from a <a href="https://www.bakertilly.com/page/about-us">globally recognized, top ten advisory, tax and assurance firm</a> seams over the top.  What is going on? What is it that you purchase from a Baker Tilly Partner. The calculations are not overly complicated. Thus, it appears to me that the high price is mostly for borrowing the firm’s reputation.</p>
							<p>Let’s look at the anatomy of the Baker Tilly Partner Affidavit:</p>
